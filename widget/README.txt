Planned_giving_widget README

This is a basic html widget built to replace the image tiles used in the PBS Planned Giving promotion project active in early 2015. The html widget resolves accessibility issues with the image tiles, which contain text better served as html text.

Note that the widget is designed to be used in responsive web designs, and will resize gracefully inside whatever responsive framework you may be using. Or you can plop it into a div with a hard-coded width between 300px and 600px, and you should be fine.

This is the “Pauline” version of the widget, and others may follow if this proves useful. 

NOTE: I have barely tested this across browsers other than Chrome and Safari. It should work just fine everywhere else, but this should be tested before deployment.
